### 🧭 Tech Treasures Challenge – Critical Minerals Exploration Dashboard  
<img src="assets/test-image.png" width="400" />

A geospatial dashboard and predictive modeling tool for rare earth element (REE) exploration in British Columbia.  
Developed for the [Tech Treasures Challenge](https://getech.com/news/getech-collaborates-with-thinkonward-to-develop-ai-powered-critical-minerals-exploration-dashboard).

<details>
<summary>More about this project</summary>
<p>
- Explores geospatial and geochemical features for REE mineralization.  
- Built Random Forest models with resampled raster inputs and categorical targets.  
- Implemented PCA and clustering (K-Means), with final results visualized in a Streamlit dashboard.  
- The pipeline includes data cleaning, raster processing, and a prospectivity map.

### 🚲 Bike Rental Demand Prediction  
<img src="assets/test-image2.png" width="400" />

Machine learning project to forecast bike rental demand during a 4-day datathon at Henry Data Science Bootcamp.

<details>
<summary>More about this project</summary>
<p>
- Explored predictors like temperature, humidity, hour, and season.  
- Compared Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ridge Regressor using GridSearchCV.  
- Applied feature binning to reduce noise and overfitting.  
- Random Forest model showed the best performance despite binning-induced overfitting.
